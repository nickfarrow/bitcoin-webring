## Join the Bitcoin Webring
### Host the Bitcoin Webring
Display the webring somewhere on your website!

The webring can be placed in the footer of your website, or on one of your pages and link from home.

To put on your website, `git clone` this repo and copy paste the small HTML & css from `webring.html` into your site's HTML, and copy the `webring-images` directory to your website directory. Style and rearrange as you please.

### Make an easy github issue
Copy the below and [make an issue](https://github.com/nickfarrow/bitcoinwebring/issues/new/choose):
```
# WebsiteName

## URL

## 240px x 60px logo (GIFs encouraged!)

[ ] I am hosting a copy of the webring on my site: LINK
```
That's it!

Alternatively you could make the html changes yourself + file upload, and submit a PR that way.
